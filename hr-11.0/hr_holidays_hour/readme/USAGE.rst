To request a leave, an employee can:

#. From menu Leaves, create a Leave Request by setting the duration in hours (instead of days)

To allocate hours for an employee:

#. From menu Leaves, create an Allocation Request by setting the duration in hours (instead of days)

To fully benefit from this module, the HR Officer should set a working time schedule for the employees.
The duration (in hours) will be automatically filled while setting the start and the end date of a leave.
In thi cas, the employee requesting a leave is still able to adjust the hours manually.

To set a working schedule for an employee:

#. From menu Employees -> Employees, select one employee
#. Set the "Working Time" field

If the "Working Time" is not set for the employee, but the employee has a contract with
a working schedule, the duration (in hours) will be automatically filled as well.

#. From menu Employees -> Employees, select one employee
#. Click on Contracts and select the employee's actual contract
#. Set the "Working Schedule" field
