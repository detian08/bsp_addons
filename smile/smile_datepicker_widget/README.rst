This module allows configuring a datepicker popup's default date to depends
on another date's value.
For example , if you have a start date and an end date (fields types can be
date or datetime), you can force end date's datepicker popup default date
to be equals to start date + 1 day.

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:


Usage
=====

In the end date field's options (the field that you want to depend on
an another datefield) add:

.. code-block:: xml

    <field name="end_date" options="{'datepicker_start_date':'name of start date's field','datepicker_step': 3}"/>


Where ``name of start date's field`` is the name of the field you want to be
followed and ``3`` (optional, by default datepicker_step = 1 ) represents
the difference (number of days) between start date and the end date's
datepicker popup default date.
