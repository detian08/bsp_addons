This module allows to track and record logs during the execution of import/export operations.

It could be useful especially during scheduled action, so instead of checking server logs, you could get the information from interface when actions successfully done or understand the main causes when things go wrong through logs.

To be able to track logs of import/export operations, make sure you give access rights to the user by adding him to the rule ``Smile Logs / User`` as follow:

#. Go to ``Settings > Users & companies > Users`` menu and select the user.
#. In ``Access Rights > Others`` check the rule ``Smile Logs / User``.

Features:

* Define an import/export template:
    * Choose a model
    * Define a method to import/export records
    * Define a domain to filter lines to export
* Create actions to generate a new import/export:
    * A client action to generate an export on the fly from records list
    * A scheduled action to generate periodically a new import/export
* Log execution

Case of load balancing
======================

If Odoo runs with several servers, with load balancing, you need to set the option `hostname`
inside the configuration file of each server (default: `localhost`).

If you don't set it, as PID of process created on an host is not visible by the others,
at each restart of one of the other host, the import/export process will be marked as *Killed*.
