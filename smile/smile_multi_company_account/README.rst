This module depends on ``Multi-Company Base`` module parameters. It makes invoices attached to invoicing company, instead of attaching the invoice natively to the connected user's company, it will be registered by the invoicing company carried by the record.

Features:

* Add a filter by invoicing company in invoices.
* Automatically set ``Is Invoicing Company`` to true if company is an invoicing company (has a Chart of Accounts).
* Make possible to validate an invoice for a company different from that of the connected user, and this invoice will be registered in account by attached company and not that of connected user.

           :width: 850px

#. Even if the user ``user01`` has created the invoice attached to his company ``A1``, the user ``user02`` from the parent company can validate this invoice by keeping the company A1 already attached.
