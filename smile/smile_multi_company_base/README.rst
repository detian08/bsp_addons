This module allows managing connection to companies in case of multi company. It also changes the behavior of company_dependent fields, instead of being calculated natively from the connected user's company, they are calculated from the company carried by the record.

Features:

* Allows to log in or not to a company.
* Select with which companies it is possible to connect.
* For example in invoicing module, it makes possible to validate an invoice for a company different from that of the connected user, and this invoice will be registered in account by attached company and not that of connected user.

    * Even if the user ``user01`` has created the invoice attached to his company ``A1``, the user ``user02`` from the parent company can validate this invoice by keeping the company A1 already attached.
